# GNN Community Detection

Community detection is a fundamental task in network science and machine learning. This project explores community detection using **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** and clustering techniques, applied to the **Cora citation dataset**.

## 🎯 Features

- Loads the **Cora citation graph** using **DGL**.  

- Computes **Jaccard dissimilarity** between node features.

- Builds a **dissimilarity matrix** for community analysis.

- Applies **Agglomerative Clustering** to detect communities.

- Visualizes clusters and computes intra-cluster similarity.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **DGL (Deep Graph Library)**
- **NumPy**
- **SciPy**
- **scikit-learn**
- **Matplotlib**
